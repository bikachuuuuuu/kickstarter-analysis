## Overview of Project
### Purpose
Our client Louise needs data analysis regarding launch date and funding projections in order to make decisions regarding her upcoming production *Fever*. In this report, we have analyzed over 17,000 points of theater data regarding various productions and their outcomes (whether they resulted in a successful, failed, or cancelled funding campaigns) to help Louise. This report will analyze how these outcomes were affected by the following variables: launch date and fundraising goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e50f0993c99944ff277967b84c60f55a/281d0c374ddfa28a-b1/s540x810/4d2bb3a12105df6137ff8a0cd0f4e3176481391b.pnj)


The above line graph depicts the cumulative number of theater productions that resulted in a successful fundraiser (the blue line), a failed fundraiser (red line), and a cancelled fundraiser (yellow line), based on which month of the year their fundraising campaigns were launched, using data from 1,369 theater productions.

We can see three months where there are spikes of successful campaigns on the blue line: February, May, and October. We also see that the cancelled campaign line also seems to follow this trend, but not as dramatically as the successful campaigns.
We should note that there is a 30 point, 60 point, and 10 point spread between successful and failed campaigns for the months of February, May, and October respectively.

The month of May has the highest count of successful campaigns, but also has the one of the highest peaks for cancelled campaigns.

It should be noted that there are very low instances of cancelled campaigns at any given point in the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c70b18b7ce8344805b902e19c5330fa9/36b48f30f3ce811c-71/s540x810/b186b0fba110a0aef677fcb9c7afe84cb37ecb54.pnj)
The above line graph depicts the percentage of theater productions that resulted in a successful fundraiser (the blue line), a failed fundraiser (red line), and a cancelled fundraiser (yellow line), based on what level of financial bracket for the fundraising goal, starting at less than $1000 and raising every $5000, using data from a total of 3,956 theater productions.

We should note that the failed (red) and cancelled (yellow) campaign projection lines seem to increase as the goal is larger and larger, while the successful campaign projection lines trend downward as the goal gets larger and larger.

Curiously, there is a peak at the $3000-$4000 goal points, where successful campaigns suddenly rise above the failed the campaign numbers, before resuming downward after the $4000 mark. The failed campaigns also suddenly drop at the $3000-$4000 goal points, before resuming to sharply increase after the $4000 mark.

Another point of inflection lies at the $10,000 to $15,000 goal mark. That that point, success and failure intersect. Before that point, there is a higher chance that the fundraising goal will be met, after that point there is a lower chance that the fundraising goal will be met.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
We should note that we cannot verify the validity of this dataset. The dataset was given to us via a digital boot camp, where the sources were not listed. It is entirely possible that this is fake data that will give no insight whatsoever to Louise.

We also do not know the specifics of the production *Fever*. We have data regarding locations of certain plays, such as the US and Great Britain, but that specific was not provided to us. We also have data regarding the outcomes based on goal funding brackets, but we do not know the projected goal of *Fever*, despite the disclosure that it has almost met its goal.

## Results


### Outcomes based on Launch Date

The one conclusion we can draw from the Outcomes based on Launch Date data is that Louise should not worry about the fundraiser suddenly becoming cancelled, as that is very unlikely to happen, based on our results shown in the first line graph.

The second conclusion is that Louise should have aimed to launch her campaign during one of the following months: February, May, or October. It is in our professional opinion that May is the best month to launch a campaign, as the spread between successful and failed campaigns is the greatest, therefore the odds of the campaign being successful is high.

### Outcomes based on Goals

A conclusion we can draw based on the Outcomes based on Goals data set is that the higher the fundraising goal, the lower the chance that Louise will be able to finance her production. It is in our professional opinion that Louise should have stuck to a lower goal, preferably below the $10,000 to $15,000 goal bracket.

### Limitations

Our analysis had several limitations. Firstly, it would have been helpful to know more about Louise's production so we could better tailor our analysis to fit her needs.

Regardless, we also do not know the source of the data. It's very possible, if not likely, that it is made up.

### Further Research

Given more information, we could have served Louise much better to help her plan for the launch of her kickerstarter campaign to fund *Fever.*

Had we known what country this production would be played, we could have further tailored our data to the individual country. The same argument could be made for knowing what the funding goal and month Louise began her campaign, so we could calculate the odds of success.

But looking at the data given, we could have created more columns to see how the length of campaigns affected their outcomes. A line graph would have been a great visual to see how the lines for success and failure trended upward or downward, the longer the campaign's went on. We also could have looked to see if certain countries are more likely to have successful campaigns, which could have guided Louise as to where to stage *Fever*, if that was an option. We could have created a table showing which countries have the highest success rates, with a bar graph to make a clear visual.
